# Radiate Toolkit (Python)

A set of Python 3 bindings for ISARA's cryptographic toolkit.

The
[Radiate Quantum-safe Toolkit](https://www.isara.com/products/isara-radiate.html)
is a set of cryptographic algorithms that aren't cracked by an adversary with a
quantum computer. It includes key exchange mechanisms and digital signatures
schemes from
[NIST's Post-Quantum Cryptography](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography)
project, as well as IETF-standard digital signature schemes
([HSS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8554) and
[XMSS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8391)) and useful building blocks.

These bindings let you use the toolkit 3.0 from Python 3.
